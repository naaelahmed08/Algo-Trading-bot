    "### Step-by-Step Explanation with Detailed Questions and Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Install `yfinance`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install yfinance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. **What is `yfinance`?**\n",
    "   - `yfinance` is a Python library that allows users to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why do we need to install `yfinance`?**\n",
    "   - We need to install `yfinance` to fetch live market data for our trading bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How do we install `yfinance`?**\n",
    "   - By using the command `!pip install yfinance` in a Jupyter notebook or `pip install yfinance` in a command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Import Libraries**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import yfinance as yf\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "import time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. **What does `import yfinance as yf` do?**\n",
    "   - This imports the `yfinance` library and allows us to refer to it as `yf` in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why are we importing `datetime`?**\n",
    "   - We use `datetime` to handle date and time, specifically for timestamping trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is the purpose of `time`?**\n",
    "   - The `time` module allows us to introduce delays in our code, such as waiting between fetching new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Base Class for Trading Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Base class for trading strategies\n",
    "class TradingStrategy:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def generate_signal(self, price_data):\n",
    "        print(\"This method should be overridden by subclasses\")\n",
    "        return \"hold\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. **What is a class?**\n",
    "   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is the purpose of `TradingStrategy`?**\n",
    "   - `TradingStrategy` is a base class for defining different trading strategies. It provides a common interface that all trading strategies will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why do we use a constructor (`__init__` method)?**\n",
    "   - The constructor initializes the class with a `name` attribute when an instance is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What does `generate_signal` do in this context?**\n",
    "   - `generate_signal` is a placeholder method intended to be overridden by subclasses. It prints a message and returns \"hold\" by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Why is `generate_signal` not implemented here?**\n",
    "   - It's meant to be overridden by subclasses to provide specific implementation details for different trading strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What are private attributes?**\n",
    "   - Private attributes are attributes that cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. They are prefixed with double underscores (`__`).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Why make `__name` private?**\n",
    "   - To enforce encapsulation and ensure that the attribute cannot be modified directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What is the `@property` decorator?**\n",
    "   - The `@property` decorator is used to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute. It allows us to access the private attribute `__name` as a read-only property.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Simple Moving Average Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Simple Moving Average Strategy\n",
    "class SMAStrategy(TradingStrategy):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, short_window, long_window):\n",
    "        super().__init__(\"Simple Moving Average Strategy\")\n",
    "        self.__short_window = short_window\n",
    "        self.__long_window = long_window\n",
    "\n",
    "    def generate_signal(self, price_data):\n",
    "        if len(price_data) < self.__long_window:\n",
    "            return \"hold\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "        short_avg = sum(price_data[-self.__short_window:]) / self.__short_window\n",
    "        long_avg = sum(price_data[-self.__long_window:]) / self.__long_window\n",
    "        \n",
    "        if short_avg > long_avg:\n",
    "            return \"buy\"\n",
    "        elif short_avg < long_avg:\n",
    "            return \"sell\"\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return \"hold\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def short_window(self):\n",
    "        return self.__short_window\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def long_window(self):\n",
    "        return self.__long_window\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. **What is inheritance in OOP?**\n",
    "   - Inheritance is an OOP concept where a new class (subclass) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (base class).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How does `SMAStrategy` use inheritance?**\n",
    "   - `SMAStrategy` inherits from `TradingStrategy`, meaning it gets all the attributes and methods of `TradingStrategy` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What does `super().__init__(\"Simple Moving Average Strategy\")` do?**\n",
    "   - It calls the constructor of the base class (`TradingStrategy`) and sets the `name` attribute to \"Simple Moving Average Strategy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why do we need `short_window` and `long_window`?**\n",
    "   - These parameters define the periods for calculating the short-term and long-term moving averages, which are essential for the SMA strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is method overriding?**\n",
    "   - Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **How is `generate_signal` overridden in `SMAStrategy`?**\n",
    "   - The `generate_signal` method in `SMAStrategy` calculates the short and long moving averages and returns a buy, sell, or hold signal based on their comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Why make `__short_window` and `__long_window` private?**\n",
    "   - To ensure these attributes cannot be modified directly from outside the class, maintaining encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Why use the `@property` decorator for `short_window` and `long_window`?**\n",
    "   - To provide read-only access to the private attributes `__short_window` and `__long_window`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Trade Management Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Trade management class\n",
    "class Trade:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, strategy_name, signal, amount):\n",
    "        self.__strategy_name = strategy_name\n",
    "        self.__signal = signal\n",
    "        self.__amount = amount\n",
    "        self.__timestamp = datetime.now()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def execute(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Executing {self.__signal} for {self.__amount} units using {self.__strategy_name} at {self.__timestamp}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def strategy_name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__strategy_name\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def signal(self):\n",
    "        return self.__signal\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def amount(self):\n",
    "        return self.__amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def timestamp(self):\n",
    "        return self.__timestamp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. **What is the purpose of the `Trade` class?**\n",
    "   - The `Trade` class manages individual trades, including the strategy name, signal, amount, and timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why do we need a timestamp?**\n",
    "   - The timestamp records the exact time when the trade is executed, which is important for tracking and analyzing trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What does the `execute` method do?**\n",
    "   - The `execute` method prints the details of the trade being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How does this class demonstrate encapsulation?**\n",
    "   - Encapsulation is shown by grouping trade-related data and behaviors (attributes and methods) within the `Trade` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Why make `__strategy_name`, `__signal`, `__amount`, and `__timestamp` private?**\n",
    "   - To ensure these attributes cannot be modified directly from outside the class, maintaining encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Why use the `@property` decorator for these attributes?**\n",
    "   - To provide read-only access to the private attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Mock Trading API**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Mock trading API\n",
    "class MockTradingAPI:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    def place_order(self, trade, price):\n",
    "        if trade.signal == \"buy\" and self.__balance >= trade.amount * price:\n",
    "            self.__balance -= trade.amount * price\n",
    "            print(f\"Placed buy order for {trade.amount} units at {price}. Remaining balance: {self.__balance}\")\n",
    "        elif trade.signal == \"sell\":\n",
    "            self.__balance += trade.amount * price\n",
    "            print(f\"Placed sell order for {trade.amount} units at {price}. Remaining balance: {self.__balance}\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Insufficient balance or invalid signal.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. **What is the purpose of the `MockTradingAPI` class?**\n",
    "   - The `MockTradingAPI` class simulates a trading API to place orders and manage the balance without interacting with a real trading platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why do we need a mock API?**\n",
    "   - A mock API allows us to test our trading bot's logic without risking real money or needing access to a live trading account.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What does the `place_order` method do?**\n",
    "   - The `place_order` method updates the balance based on the trade signal and prints the order details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How does the `get_balance` method work?**\n",
    "   - The `get_balance` method simply returns the current balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is encapsulation and how is it demonstrated here?**\n",
    "   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within one unit, e.g., a class. Here, balance management and order placement are\n",
    "\n",
    " encapsulated within the `MockTradingAPI` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Why make `__balance` private?**\n",
    "   - To ensure the balance attribute cannot be modified directly from outside the class, maintaining encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Why not use `@property` decorator for `__balance`?**\n",
    "   - Because the `get_balance` method already serves the purpose of providing controlled access to the private attribute `__balance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Main Trading System**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Main trading system\n",
    "class TradingSystem:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, api, strategy, symbol):\n",
    "        self.__api = api\n",
    "        self.__strategy = strategy\n",
    "        self.__symbol = symbol\n",
    "        self.__price_data = []\n",
    "\n",
    "    def fetch_price_data(self):\n",
    "        data = yf.download(tickers=self.__symbol, period='1d', interval='1m')\n",
    "        if not data.empty:\n",
    "            price = data['Close'].iloc[-1]\n",
    "            self.__price_data.append(price)\n",
    "            if len(self.__price_data) > self.__strategy.long_window:\n",
    "                self.__price_data.pop(0)\n",
    "            print(f\"Fetched new price data: {price}\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"No data fetched\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def run(self):\n",
    "        self.fetch_price_data()\n",
    "        signal = self.__strategy.generate_signal(self.__price_data)\n",
    "        print(f\"Generated signal: {signal}\")\n",
    "        if signal in [\"buy\", \"sell\"]:\n",
    "            trade = Trade(self.__strategy.name, signal, 1)\n",
    "            trade.execute()\n",
    "            self.__api.place_order(trade, self.__price_data[-1])\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def api(self):\n",
    "        return self.__api\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def strategy(self):\n",
    "        return self.__strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def symbol(self):\n",
    "        return self.__symbol\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def price_data(self):\n",
    "        return self.__price_data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. **What is the purpose of the `TradingSystem` class?**\n",
    "   - The `TradingSystem` class integrates the trading API, strategy, and symbol to manage the overall trading process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What does the `fetch_price_data` method do?**\n",
    "   - It fetches the latest market data using `yfinance`, processes it, and updates the price data list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why do we use `yf.download` to fetch data?**\n",
    "   - `yf.download` is a method from the `yfinance` library that downloads historical market data for the specified symbol and time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What does the `run` method do?**\n",
    "   - The `run` method fetches the latest price data, generates a trading signal, and executes a trade if a buy or sell signal is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How does this class demonstrate composition?**\n",
    "   - Composition is shown by the `TradingSystem` class being composed of instances of other classes (`MockTradingAPI`, `SMAStrategy`).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Why make `__api`, `__strategy`, `__symbol`, and `__price_data` private?**\n",
    "   - To ensure these attributes cannot be modified directly from outside the class, maintaining encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Why use the `@property` decorator for these attributes?**\n",
    "   - To provide read-only access to the private attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Main Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    symbol = 'AAPL'\n",
    "\n",
    "    api = MockTradingAPI(balance=10000)\n",
    "    strategy = SMAStrategy(short_window=3, long_window=5)\n",
    "    system = TradingSystem(api, strategy, symbol)\n",
    "\n",
    "    for _ in range(10):\n",
    "        system.run()\n",
    "        print(f\"Remaining balance: {api.get_balance()}\")\n",
    "        time.sleep(60)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. **What does `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` do?**\n",
    "   - This construct ensures that the code block runs only if the script is executed directly. It prevents the code from running if the script is imported as a module in another script.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why do we instantiate `MockTradingAPI`, `SMAStrategy`, and `TradingSystem`?**\n",
    "   - To create instances of these classes and set up the trading system with the specified strategy and symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is the purpose of the loop `for _ in range(10):`?**\n",
    "   - To simulate a trading session by running the trading system in a loop, fetching data, and executing trades every minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why do we use `time.sleep(60)`?**\n",
    "   - To wait for a minute before fetching new data, simulating real-time data fetching and trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Python and OOP Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes and Objects**: Define reusable blueprints (classes) and create instances (objects) of those classes.\n",
    "2. **Inheritance**: `SMAStrategy` inherits from `TradingStrategy`, allowing reuse and extension of code.\n",
    "3. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulating data within classes and providing methods to interact with that data.\n",
    "4. **Method Overriding**: Subclass (`SMAStrategy`) overrides the method (`generate_signal`) of the base class (`TradingStrategy`).\n",
    "5. **Polymorphism**: The ability to call the same method on different objects and have each of them respond in a way appropriate to its own class.\n",
    "6. **Composition**: Using objects of other classes as attributes, e.g., `TradingSystem` uses `MockTradingAPI` and `SMAStrategy`.\n",
    "7. **Private Attributes**: Making attributes private to enforce encapsulation and data hiding.\n",
    "8. **Properties**: Using the `@property` decorator to provide controlled access to private attributes.\n",

    "Sure, let's go through the flow of what happens in the trading bot, step by step, without code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow of the Trading Bot\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - The script starts with initializing necessary components: a mock trading API, a trading strategy, and the trading system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define the Stock Symbol**:\n",
    "   - The stock symbol to trade is defined (e.g., 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create Mock Trading API**:\n",
    "   - An instance of the `MockTradingAPI` is created with an initial balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create Trading Strategy**:\n",
    "   - An instance of the `SMAStrategy` is created with specified short and long windows for moving averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create Trading System**:\n",
    "   - An instance of the `TradingSystem` is created, integrating the mock API, the trading strategy, and the stock symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Running the Trading Bot**:\n",
    "   - The trading bot runs in a loop for a specified number of iterations (e.g., 10 times).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Fetch Price Data**:\n",
    "   - In each iteration, the `TradingSystem` fetches the latest price data for the stock symbol using `yfinance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Generate Trading Signal**:\n",
    "   - The trading strategy analyzes the fetched price data to generate a trading signal, which can be \"buy\", \"sell\", or \"hold\".\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Create Trade Object**:\n",
    "   - If the signal is \"buy\" or \"sell\", a `Trade` object is created with the generated signal and a specified trade amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Execute Trade**:\n",
    "    - The `Trade` object's `execute` method is called to log the trade details.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Place Order**:\n",
    "    - The `Trade` object is passed to the `MockTradingAPI`'s `place_order` method, which processes the trade:\n",
    "      - **Buy Order**: If the signal is \"buy\" and there is enough balance, the balance is decreased by the trade amount multiplied by the price.\n",
    "      - **Sell Order**: If the signal is \"sell\", the balance is increased by the trade amount multiplied by the price.\n",
    "      - If the balance is insufficient for a buy order or the signal is invalid, an error message is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Print Balance**:\n",
    "    - After each trade, the current balance is printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Wait Before Next Iteration**:\n",
    "    - The script pauses for a specified duration (e.g., 60 seconds) before the next iteration to simulate real-time trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Components**: Set up the stock symbol, mock trading API, trading strategy, and trading system.\n",
    "2. **Run Trading Bot**: Enter a loop to simulate trading over multiple intervals.\n",
    "3. **Fetch Data**: Retrieve the latest stock price data.\n",
    "4. **Generate Signal**: Use the trading strategy to generate a \"buy\", \"sell\", or \"hold\" signal.\n",
    "5. **Create Trade**: If the signal is \"buy\" or \"sell\", create a trade object with the signal.\n",
    "6. **Execute Trade**: Log the trade details.\n",
    "7. **Place Order**: Process the trade through the mock trading API, updating the balance accordingly.\n",
    "8. **Print Balance**: Display the current balance after each trade.\n",

    "### What is the `@property` Decorator?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@property` decorator in Python is a built-in decorator that allows you to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes. It provides a way to manage the access to instance attributes, allowing you to implement getter, setter, and deleter methods in a clean and intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use `@property`?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: You can control access to private attributes and ensure that any access or modification is done through defined methods.\n",
    "2. **Readability**: It allows you to access methods as if they were attributes, making the code more readable.\n",
    "3. **Validation**: You can add validation logic in setter methods to ensure that the data being assigned is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Without `@property`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self._radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_radius(self):\n",
    "        return self._radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_radius(self, radius):\n",
    "        if radius >= 0:\n",
    "            self._radius = radius\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n",
    "\n",
    "c = Circle(5)\n",
    "print(c.get_radius())  # Accessing radius\n",
    "c.set_radius(10)       # Setting radius\n",
    "print(c.get_radius())  # Accessing radius\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With `@property`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self._radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def radius(self):\n",
    "        return self._radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    @radius.setter\n",
    "    def radius(self, radius):\n",
    "        if radius >= 0:\n",
    "            self._radius = radius\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n",
    "\n",
    "c = Circle(5)\n",
    "print(c.radius)  # Accessing radius using property\n",
    "c.radius = 10    # Setting radius using property\n",
    "print(c.radius)  # Accessing radius using property\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of `@property`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Getter Method**: Defined with the `@property` decorator. It allows you to access the method as if it were an attribute.\n",
    "2. **Setter Method**: Defined with `@<property_name>.setter` decorator. It allows you to set the value of an attribute and include validation logic.\n",
    "3. **Private Attributes**: Typically, the actual data is stored in a private attribute (e.g., `_radius`), and the property provides controlled access to this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Temperature Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Temperature:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, celsius):\n",
    "        self._celsius = celsius\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def celsius(self):\n",

    "            raise ValueError(\"Temperature cannot be below absolute zero\")\n",
    "        self._celsius = value\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def fahrenheit(self):\n",
    "        return (self._celsius * 9/5) + 32\n",
    "\n",
    "    @fahrenheit.setter\n",
    "    def fahrenheit(self, value):\n",
    "        self._celsius = (value - 32) * 5/9\n",
    "\n",
    "t = Temperature(25)\n",
    "print(t.celsius)       # 25\n",
    "print(t.fahrenheit)    # 77.0\n",
    "\n",
    "t.fahrenheit = 212\n",
    "print(t.celsius)       # 100.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Bank Account Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "        self._balance = balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def balance(self):\n",
    "        return self._balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    @balance.setter\n",
    "    def balance(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount < 0:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Balance cannot be negative\")\n",
    "        self._balance = amount\n",
    "\n",
    "account = BankAccount(100)\n",
    "print(account.balance)  # 100\n",
    "\n",
    "account.balance = 200\n",
    "print(account.balance)  # 200\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    account.balance = -50\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)  # Balance cannot be negative\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@property` decorator in Python is a powerful tool that provides a clean way to manage access to instance attributes, allowing you to add getter, setter, and deleter methods. It enhances encapsulation, readability, and validation in your code. By using `@property`, you can control how attributes are accessed and modified, ensuring that any necessary checks or transformations are performed seamlessly."
